# City-Zip-Weather
This is a project I created for a software development course.
# Synopsys
The goal of this project is to create an application in Java 17 using JavaFX 17 that integrates two or more external RESTful JSON APIs.
I chose to implement an application named ApiApp that integrates external APIs to provide information about weather and geographic data. The main purpose of the application is to allow users to search for ZIP codes of a city and retrieve weather data for specific geographic coordinates. The program is designed to provide users with the ability to search for ZIP codes in a given city and state, retrieve weather data based on latitude and longitude coordinates, and display the results in a graphical user interface.
## API Integration
The program interacts with two external APIs: Zippopotamus and the Weather API from API Ninjas. The Zippopotamus API is used to retrieve ZIP code information for a given city and state, and the results obtained from the Zippopotamus API are directly used to query the Weather API. The Weather API is used to fetch weather data based on latitude and longitude coordinates.
